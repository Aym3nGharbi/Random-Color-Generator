## 🧠 How It Works

1. The page creates 30 `<div>` elements dynamically.
2. Each box is assigned:
   - A random hex color as background
   - The hex code as text content
3. The `randomColor()` function uses a predefined string of characters to generate 6-digit hex codes.
4. All boxes are styled with CSS for layout and text visibility.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each reload triggers a new set of colors.
- You can expand functionality by adding a "Refresh" button or copying the hex code to clipboard.
